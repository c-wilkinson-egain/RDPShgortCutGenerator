# RDPShortCutGenerator
Builds an RDP shortcut to connect to multiple screens but not all screens.  i.e. if you have a laptop connected to two monitors, this will allow the laptop to not be connected.

This allows the ability to select a subset of monitors with full screen.  In the UI when connecting, you can choose all or 1 but cannot choose for instance 2 of 3 (full screen).  
This script builds an RDP shortcut that connects to 2 of 3 monitors in full screen mode.
